# Understanding AI Grounding in Mobile Testing

Traditional automated testing relies on fragile element selectors that break when UIs change. Revyl takes a different approach using AI grounding.

## What is AI Grounding?

AI grounding is the process of connecting natural language instructions to specific UI elements on screen. When you say "tap the login button," our AI:

1. Captures the current screen state
2. Identifies all interactive elements
3. Maps your instruction to the most relevant element
4. Executes the action with precision

## Why This Matters

### Resilience to UI Changes

When a developer moves a button or changes its text from "Login" to "Sign In," traditional tests break. AI-grounded tests understand intent, not just selectors.

### Natural Language Interface

Write tests the way you think about them:
- "Scroll down until you see the Subscribe button"
- "Type 'hello@example.com' in the email field"
- "Verify the success message appears"

### Cross-Platform Consistency

The same natural language test works on both Android and iOS, even though the underlying UI structures differ.

## The Technical Stack

Revyl's grounding pipeline uses:
- **Vision models** for screen understanding
- **BAML** for structured LLM interactions
- **Platform-specific automation** (UIAutomator2, XCTest) for reliable execution

## Results in Practice

Our customers see:
- 80% reduction in test maintenance
- 3x faster test creation
- Higher confidence in test reliability
