# Getting Started with Revyl

Setting up automated mobile testing has never been easier. In this guide, we'll walk you through everything you need to get started with Revyl.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- A Revyl account (sign up at app.revyl.ai)
- Access to your mobile app's APK or IPA file
- Basic understanding of your app's user flows

## Step 1: Upload Your App

Once you're logged in, navigate to the Apps section and upload your mobile application. Revyl supports both Android (APK) and iOS (IPA) files.

## Step 2: Create Your First Test

Click "New Test" and describe what you want to test in natural language. For example:
- "Log in with test credentials and verify the dashboard loads"
- "Add an item to cart and proceed to checkout"

## Step 3: Run and Monitor

Hit run and watch as Revyl executes your test in real-time. You'll see the device screen, action logs, and instant results.

## What's Next?

Once you've run your first test, explore:
- **Graph Editor**: Build complex test flows visually
- **Test History**: Review past runs and track flaky tests
- **Variables**: Create reusable test data

Happy testing!
